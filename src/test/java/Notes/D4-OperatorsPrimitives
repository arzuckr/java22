////# Char Data Type

-in Java a char is a short for "character.
-This primitive data type is used the store single character
-unlike other data type char can only hold single character
-Size of this data type is char 16-bit.
''' java

char letter = 'T';
char symbol='5';
char symbol='&';

## Is char still used?
**Less common today**:Nowadays string(text type) are more popular because it can hold multiple character,
 // and more versatile.

 **Why the 'char' data type created?
 When java first created 'memory resources very limited',and it was efficient

 ##How is char related to ASCII and unicode?
 1-ASCII(American Standard Code For Information Interchange)
 *ASCII is a 7 -bit character encoding standard that represent 128 characters ,
 including letters.Digit and symbols.


 2.Unicode
 *Java char is based on Unicode ,which is more comprehensive version of ASCII
 *Unlike ASCII,which is limited 128 characters,Unicode
 supports 143000 characters,including symbol ,emojis...
 ** NOTE**
 Char data type can be assigned with numerical value or can be assigned with a value within
 single quotation.
 When char data type is assigned with a numerical value,it finds the matching numerical value from Unicode or
 ASCII  table and then assigns itself with that character.

  ''java
  char ch=122;
  System.out.println(ch); // This will print letter "z'



   #Declaration,initialization,Assignment,Reassignment,and Compound Assignment Operators.

 1- Declaration 
  *Declaration is a data type to variable.
''' java 
public class test{
public static void main(String)[]args{

int var:
double number ;
char c1;
long l2;
// All of the above is an example to declaration in java programming.
//These ara called declaring variable.
 2- Initialization initializing is assigning value to variable.
**
''' java
public class test{
public static void main(String)[]args{
int var:
double number ;
char c1;
long l2;
//We are going to initialize the declared variable above.

var =10;
number=17.9;
c1='!';

3-Assignment,Reassignment
-The asssignment operator '=' is used to store value  a value in a variable.It asigns
-the values on the right side the operator to the variable on left.
'''java

int number=6;// variable number is assigned value 6.
int num1;
num1=8;// result is 8

''' java
public class test{
public static void main(String)[]args{

double dl=7;
System.out.printLn(d1);//7
d1=19.8;
result is 19.8

d1=d1+d1+.4;
result is 40.0

// The output will be 40.0


d1='y';

System.out.printLn(d1)
it doesn't work 

d1='y';
result is 121.0


        int num1=11;
        num1=num1+4.0;
        System.out.println(num1)

//we cannot the change data typeof a variable   when reassigning.

    4- Compound Reassignment Operators
    +=,-=,*=,/=,%=

   -Compound Reassignment Operators are shorter way of writing expressions where a variable
is modified and then assigned with a new value.

1-'+='
-This operator will add and then reassign.
-'x+=5' is 'x=x+5'

2- '-='
'var -=10' is 'var=var-10'

3-'*='
-This operator will multiply and  then reassign.
-'x*=5' is 'x=x*5'

4- '/='
'var /=10' is 'var=var/10'

5-'%='
'var%=3' is 'var=var%3"
