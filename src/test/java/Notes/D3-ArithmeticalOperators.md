int result=5+3-6*3+2*8; 
System.out.println(result);//6

//Division 


Divide the first value by second. (quotient)

If there is both multiplication and division in the calculation,we are going to start 
from left to right.

'''java 

//If there is 10 kids in the house, and we have 
//20 chocolate for them.Let's calculate how many chocolate each kid will get

int numberOfKids=10
int numberOfChocolate=20
System.out.println(eachKidWillGet);


//Each family will bring 3 kids
//10 fam coming to the party
//there is total 60 candies.How many candies each kids will get uf tey are given 
equally

int numOfKidsInFamily=3;
int totalFamily=10;
int numOfCandies=60;
int candyForEachKid= numOfCandies/ (numOfKidsFamily*numberOfFamily)
                        60/(3*10)=2
System.out.println(candyForEachKid);
//2

Note:Using parentheses add priority to that operation ,so always operation in 
parentheses done first.Operations always first done  parentheses . If there is more than 
one  parentheses  we do left to right.

*Remainder Operators
- Remainder operators is used to determine what is left over 
- when a number is divided by another.
- It gives use the leftover part after performing a division .
- For example ,if you divide the 10 by 3, the quotient is 3,but the remainder is 1.
- ''java
int num1=67;
int num2=7;
int result = num1%num2;
System.out.println(result);//->4
int result2 = num2%num1;//7%67
System.out.println(result2);//7

NOTE:
If you find remainder of a big number from a small number 
the result will be small number itself. Such as ;
5%11->,13%14->13 etc.

*Remainder operator has a same precedence as multiplication ,and division.
If there is a multiplication,division and remainder operator present 
in same arithmetical operation they will be done from left to right.
